# dwmbar

A personal status bar for the Dynamic Window Manager (DWM).

## Installation

Clone the repository

```git clone git://github.com/madhatter/dwmbar.git```

As it's my very personal status bar you may have to change
some paths for your environment in the `dwmbar.h` header file
to set the correct network device names or where to get the
battery informations.

Now `make` and run `./dwmbar`.
